# 📊 Sales Analysis & Visualization with Python

This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and business insight extraction using Python and pandas.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## 📁 Dataset
A simulated dataset containing:
- Product sales (Wall Panels, Wallpaper Rolls, Decor Kits)
- Quantity, unit price, total revenue
- Date and region of each sale

## 📈 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled data types (e.g. converted dates)
   - Removed duplicates using subset logic
   - Verified categorical consistency (products & regions)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics with `df.describe()`
   - ABC classification based on revenue
   - Detection of best-selling product, city and date

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plot: Total revenue by product
   - Bar plot: Total revenue by region
   - Line plot: Daily revenue trend

4. **Business Insights**
   - Identified top product and city for revenue
   - Suggested recommendations for inventory, marketing and seasonal strategy
   - Delivered clean, documented code and markdown analysis

## 📌 Key Findings
- 🅰️ **Wall Panels** are the top-selling product by revenue
- 📍 **Bogotá** and **Cali** are the best-performing regions
- 📆 Most profitable day identified for strategic planning

## 📄 Output
All results, code and visualizations are available in the notebook file:
